## ðŸ“£ COMMENTS
**Considerations to be taken while developing the codes:**

- We will use the **camel case pattern** for commits and branch names.
- Regarding the default variables defined in code, we will decide this in the future. For now, if it works, that's fine.
- Always try to know the other areas of the robot, especially the electronics.
- Be careful with unnecessary comments, sometimes it's better to delete everything and start from scratch.
